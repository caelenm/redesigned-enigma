# Welcome to Sustainable Living Docs

Welcome to the Sustainable Living Docs, your guide to adopting sustainable and self-sufficient practices. This guide provides information and resources to help you get started on your journey towards a more sustainable lifestyle.

## What is Sustainable Living?

Sustainable living involves making choices that have a positive impact on the environment and contribute to a more self-sufficient way of life. It encompasses practices such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and cultivating sustainable food sources.

## Why Sustainable Living Docs?

Sustainable Living Docs is a resource hub designed to assist individuals in embracing sustainable practices. Whether you're new to sustainable living or looking to deepen your understanding, our guide offers valuable insights and practical tips.

## In addition to the guide, we provide:

- **Example Projects:** Explore real-world projects that showcase sustainable and self-sufficient practices.
- **Community Resources:** Connect with like-minded individuals and communities to share ideas and experiences.
- **Practical Advice:** Find actionable tips on reducing your ecological footprint and living a more sustainable life.

## What Sustainable Living Docs does not provide:

- **Specific Source Hosting:** While our guide is hosted on GitHub, you are free to adapt it to your preferred source hosting platform.
- **Site Deployment:** Information on deploying your site can be found in our documentation. This guide uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

Sustainable Living Docs is not a site generator; it relies on platforms like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to convert Markdown into static web pages.

## Is Sustainable Living Docs for me?

Sustainable Living Docs is ideal for individuals and communities interested in sustainable living practices. Whether you are just starting or managing a larger project, our guide provides resources to support your journey.

If your project is smaller, consider simpler solutions or a good README file to convey your message effectively. For larger projects, customize our guide to suit your specific needs.
